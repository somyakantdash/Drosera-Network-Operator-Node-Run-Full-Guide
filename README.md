# Drosera-Network-Operator-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
Drosera is a decentralized incident response protocol aimed at addressing and mitigating security exploits within blockchain ecosystems. By employing a novel approach to security, Drosera introduces a mechanism where protocols can establish hidden security measures known as Traps. These Traps are smart contracts designed to remain off-chain, preserving the confidentiality of security strategies until needed.

## Key Features
- Traps: Customizable smart contracts for real-time threat detection and automated responses.
- Decentralized Response: Node operators monitor and mitigate threats, forming Ethereum’s "immune system."
- Security Marketplace: Protocols set security needs; operators earn rewards for responses.
- EVM-Native: Seamless integration with Ethereum, leveraging EigenLayer for shared security.
- Automation: Simplifies monitoring with developer-friendly tools.
- Operator Incentives: Rewards for running nodes and executing Traps.
- Versatile Use Cases: Supports DeFi, governance, and multisig security.
- Trappers: New role for crafting specialized security logic.
